# Awk Exercises

This TUI application includes 80+ questions meant to be solved using `GNU awk`. Some exercises will require you to combine `awk` with other CLI tools such as `tac`.

> **Note**  
> This application is intended to be run in a Linux-like environment. You might still be able to solve the exercises on other platforms, but I do not know if that'll work.

# Installation

TODO: PyPI package

As an alternative, you can install `textual` (see [Textual documentation](https://textual.textualize.io/getting_started/) for more details), clone this repository and run the `awk_exercises.py` file.

Adjust the terminal dimensions for the widgets to appear properly, for example 84x25 (characters x lines). Here's a sample screenshot:
