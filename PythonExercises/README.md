# Python Exercises

This interactive TUI app is intended to test the understanding of beginner to intermediate level Python learners.

> **Warning:** This is a work-in-progress project.

# Installation

Install `textual` (see [Textual documentation](https://textual.textualize.io/getting_started/) for more details), clone this repository and run the `python_exercises.py` file. You'll need to install `textual[syntax]` to enable syntax highlighting (see [documentation](https://textual.textualize.io/widgets/text_area/#syntax-highlighting-dependencies) for more details).

Adjust the terminal dimensions for the widgets to appear properly, for example 84x25 (characters x lines).

**TODO**: PyPI app
